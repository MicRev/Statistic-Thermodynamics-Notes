## Isotopes

For isotopes, nuclear spin matters. For nuclei with different spin, the reaction differs when swapping the two. The wave function remains the same for bosons and becomes negative for femions.

Through the four operations we swap the two nuclei:
- **C2** of the whole molecule;
- **Inversion** of the electrons;
- **Reflection** of the electrons;
- **Permutation** of the nuclear spin states

The molecule term symbol for $^1 H_2$ is $^1\Sigma_g^+$. The four operations cause different effects on different nuclear spin wave functions:

        <td>anti-sym</td>

        <td>+</td>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>odd J</td>
        <td>sym</td>
        <td>-</td>

        <td>+</td>
        <td>+</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>odd J</td>
        <td>anti-sym</td>
        <td>-</td> 
        <td>+</td>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>+</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Considering the protons are fermis, only anti-symmetric overall symbols are acceptable. Therefore we conclude

- Molecules in rotational states with **even** J-values must be in **anti-symmetric** nuclear spin states. 
- Molecules in rotational states with **odd** J-values must be in **symmetric** nuclear spin states. 

We remember explicitly that the symmetric nuclear spin wave function of two H nuclears follows
$$
\alpha(1)\alpha(2) \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}({\alpha(1)\beta(2) + \alpha(2)\beta(1)})\\
\beta(1)\beta(2)
$$

and anti-symmetric ones follows
$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}({\alpha(1)\beta(2) - \alpha(2)\beta(1)})
$$

Consequently, molecules with odd J-values have a statistical weight of 3 comparing to those with even J-values, which explains the spectra of $H_2$.

## Ramen spectra of $H_2$

> Motions that with a symmetric second-order term (like $z^2$, $xy$, $x^2-y^2$) shows a Ramen signal.

The first line of Ramen spectra, where $J=0$, lies in 6B. The seperation of each two neighboured lines is 4B.

The intensity of the Ramen lines depends on the population of the energy level, which depends on the **degeneracy**, $g_J = 2J+1$, and the **energies**, $E_J = BJ(J+1)$.

Thus we have
$$
population \propto (2J+1) \exp \left( \frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT} \right)
$$

Considering the affection of nuclear spin, we have another factor contributing to degeneracy:

$$
odd J: population \propto 3 \times (2J+1) \exp \left( \frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT} \right) \\
even J: population \propto 1 \times (2J+1) \exp \left( \frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT} \right)
$$

which cause the result that the lines of odd Js are 3 times higher than those with even Js.

Other homonuclear diatomics with a nuclear spin of 1/2 shows the same result.

## Ortho- and Para-hydrogen

Actually there are two types of hydrogen in normal hydrogen, ortho-hydrogen and para-hydrogen.
In ortho-hydrogen the two nuclei have the same spin states, the molecule has odd J-states and symmetric nuclear spin states;
In para-hydrogen the two nuclei have different spin states, the molecule has even J-states and anti-symmetric nuclear spin states.

They have different physical properties, e.g. in low temperature, the heat capacity differs. Thus by physical method we can seperate the two hydrogen.

Sometimes ortho- and para-hydrogen transform to each other, like on the surface of a catalyst. As para-hydrogen involves the **lowest** energy rotational energy state whose J = 0, we end up with pure para-hydrogen at low enough temperature.

## Case of $^{14}N_2$

Different from $H_2$, $^{14}N$ atoms are bosons. Consequently, the symmetricity of swapping two atoms must be symmetric. That is to say:
- Molecules in rotational states with **even** J-values must be in **symmetric** nuclear spin states. 
- Molecules in rotational states with **odd** J-values must be in **anti-symmetric** nuclear spin states. 

Therefore, even J-states have a statistical weight of 6 and odd J-states have a weight of 3. Thus in the Ramen spectra, even Js is twice higher than odd ones.

## Cases of Spin Zero

Spin zero nuclei are always bosons. While in these cases, nuclear spins won't affect the overall symmtricity.

### Case of $^{16}O_2$

The ground state term symbol of $O_2$ is $^3 \Sigma_g^-$ Without considering nuclear spin and $p_{nuc}$, we rewrite the symmetric table:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>rotation</td>
        <td>nuclear spin</td>
        <td>C2</td>
        <td>i_elec</td>
        <td>sigma_elec</td>
        <td>p_nuc</td>
        <td>overall</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>even J</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>+</td> 
        <td>+</td>
        <td>-</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>odd J</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>-</td> 
        <td>+</td>
        <td>-</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>+</td>
    </tr>
</table>

O atoms are bosons, so only odd J-states can exist in $^{16}O_2$!

That means, the first line in Ramen rotation spectra of $^{16}O_2$ is 10B and the seperation is 8B.

### Case of $^{12}C^{16}O_2$

All atoms here are again all bosons with spin zero. The difference is that the molecule term symbol on the ground state is $^1\Sigma_g^+$, thus the table is 
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>rotation</td>
        <td>nuclear spin</td>
        <td>C2</td>
        <td>i_elec</td>
        <td>sigma_elec</td>
        <td>p_nuc</td>
        <td>overall</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>even J</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>+</td> 
        <td>+</td>
        <td>+</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>+</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>odd J</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>-</td> 
        <td>+</td>
        <td>+</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>-</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Hence we discover that $^{12}C^{16}O_2$ exists only in even J-states.

Similarly, the first line is 6B and the seperation is 8B.

We remember P-branch and R-branch in spectra, 

## Evaluation of rotational partition function

Considering the effect of nuclear spin, we rewrite the partition function by
$$
q = q_{trans} q_{NS} q_{rot} q_{vib} q_{elec}
$$

where $q_{NS}$ is the nuclear spin partition function.

The seperation works only when each energy levels are not entangled. However, sometimes nuclear spin and rotation do. So we consider the product $q_{NS} q_{rot}$:
$$
q = \sum_j g_j \exp \left(\frac{-\epsilon_j}{kT} \right)
$$

If the two nuclei have spin $I_1$ and $I_2$, then the number of total spin state is $(2I_1 + 1)(2I_2 + 1)$, which means 
$$
q_{NS} = (2I_1 + 1)(2I_2 + 1) = g_{NS}
$$

Simply multiply the two and we get
$$
\begin{aligned}
q & = q_{NS} q_{rot} \\
& = g_{NS} \sum_J (2J + 1) \exp \left(\frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

For homonuclear molecule, it's nessecary we consider odd and even $J$s.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    q = q_{NS} q_{rot} = & g_{NS, even} & \sum_{even~J} (2J + 1) \exp \left(\frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT} \right) \\
    + & g_{NS, odd}& \sum_{odd~J} (2J + 1) \exp \left(\frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Convincing that $kT \gg B$, we believe that
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{even~J} (2J + 1) \exp \left(\frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT} \right) & = \sum_{odd~J} (2J + 1) \exp \left(\frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT} \right) \\
\sum_{even~and~odd~J} (2J + 1) \exp \left(\frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT} \right) & = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{all~J} (2J + 1) \exp \left(\frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT} \right) \\
& = \frac{kT}{2B}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore we understand how rotational partition function for homonuclear molecules $q_{rot} = \frac{kT}{\sigma B}$. In other words, for homonuclear molecules,
$$
q_{NS} q_{rot} = (g_{NS, even} + g_{NS, odd}) \frac{kT}{2B} 
$$

and for heternuclear molecules, 
$$
q_{NS} q_{rot} = g_{NS} \frac{kT}{B}
$$

For more complex molecules similar consequences exists. For symmetrical linear molecules, like $CO_2$ and $HCCH$, $\sigma = 2$, while for non-linear molecules it eaquals the number of equivalent positions into which the molecule can be rotate, like $\sigma = 2$ for $H_2O$ and $\sigma = 3$ for $NH_3$
