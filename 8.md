## Isotopes

For isotopes, nuclear spin matters. For nuclei with different spin, the reaction differs when swapping the two. The wave function remains the same for bosons and becomes negative for femions.

Through the four operations we swap the two nuclei:
- **C2** of the whole molecule;
- **Inversion** of the electrons;
- **Reflection** of the electrons;
- **Permutation** of the nuclear spin states

The four operations cause different effects on different nuclear spin wave functions:

        <td>anti-sym</td>
        <td>+</td>

        <td>+</td>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>odd J</td>
        <td>sym</td>
        <td>-</td> 
        <td>+</td>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>odd J</td>
        <td>anti-sym</td>
        <td>-</td> 
        <td>+</td>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>+</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Therefore we conclude

Molecules in rotational states with **even** J-values must be in **anti-symmetric** nuclear spin states. 
Molecules in rotational states with **odd** J-values must be in **symmetric** nuclear spin states. 

We remember explicitly that the symmetric nuclear spin wave function of two H nuclears follows
$$
\alpha(1)\alpha(2) \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}({\alpha(1)\beta(2) + \alpha(2)\beta(1)})\\
\beta(1)\beta(2)
$$

and anti-symmetric ones follows
$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}({\alpha(1)\beta(2) - \alpha(2)\beta(1)})
$$

Consequently, molecules with odd J-values have a statistical weight of 3 comparing to those with even J-values, which explains the spectra of $H_2$.

## Ramen spectra of H2

> Motions that with a symmetric second-order term (like $z^2$, $xy$, $x^2-y^2$) shows a Ramen signal.

The intensity of the Ramen lines depends on the population of the energy level, which depends on the **degeneracy**, $g_J = 2J+1$, and the **energies**, $E_J = BJ(J+1)$.

Thus we have
$$
population \propto (2J+1) \exp \left( \frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT} \right)
$$

Considering the affection of nuclear spin, we have another factor contributing to degeneracy:

$$
odd J: population \propto 3 \times (2J+1) \exp \left( \frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT} \right) \\
even J: population \propto 1 \times (2J+1) \exp \left( \frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT} \right)
$$

which cause the result that the lines of odd Js are 3 times higher than those with even Js.

Other homonuclear diatomics with a nuclear spin of 1/2 shows the same result.
