## Key ideas

**Macrostate, Microstate**
Macro: the state described by **U** (internal energy), **V** (volume) and **N** (number of particles)

*no information about which energy level the particle is occupying*

Micro: particular arrangement of particles in the energy levels

three distinguishable particles, total energy 3 units, defined macrostate, 10 microstates

$$
(1, 1, 1) \times 1, (0, 1, 2) \times 6, (0, 0, 3) \times 3
$$

total energy & number of particles **increases**, seperation of energy levels **decreases**(corresponding to volume), number of microstate **increases**.

it is reasonable to assume that particles stay equally possibly at every microstate

> **Postulate 1**: for an isolated system, the probability that the system will be in any one accessible mircrostate is $1/\Omega $, where $\Omega$ is the number of microstates

can be used to explain why some processes are spontaneous(or irreversible)
e.g. const temperature gas expanding

ideal gas, one-dimension box, translational energy level:

$$
E_n = \frac{n^2 h^2}{8ma^2},~n=1, 2, 3, \cdots
$$

in three-dimension the result is the sum of three directions

in expanding case, $\Omega_{final} \gg \Omega_{initial}$, thus the system will effectively only ever be found in the final states.

a conclusion:
>  a system evolves into a state with the maximum number of accessible microstates. The existence of irreversible processes are thus explicable in terms of the idea of equally probable microstates.

> **Posulate 2**: the entropy of an isolated system is given by $S = kln\Omega$, where k is a universal constant

when bringing two system A(entropy $S_A$, microstate $\Omega_A$), B(entropy $S_B$, microstate $\Omega_B$) together, we have

$$
S_{tol} = S_A + S_B \\
\Omega_{tol} = \Omega_A \Omega_B
$$

at absolute zero, all particles are in the ground state, thus $\Omega = 1$, and $S = kln\Omega = 0$

Boltzmann constant $k$:

$$
R = N_A k
$$

init state -> final state:

$$
P_{init} \propto \Omega_{init} \\
P_{final} \propto \Omega_{final}
$$

thus

$$
\frac{P_{init}}{P_{final}} = \frac{\Omega_{init}}{\Omega_{final}} \\
= \frac{\exp(S_{init}/k)}{\exp(S_{final}/k)} \\
= \exp(-\Delta S/k)
$$

## Canonical Distribution

we talk about a system that allow heat to flow between itself and its surrounding

Taking together the system and its surrounding as a super system, it is possible to regard it as an isolated system

$$
E_{tot} = E_{sys} + E_{bath} \\
\Omega_{tot} = \Omega_{sys} \times \Omega_{bath} 
$$

situation A: $E_{sys} = 0, E_{bath} = E_{tot}$
situation B: $E_{sys} = E_m, E_{bath} = E_{tot} - E_m$

forcing two cases to be in one microstate, 

$$
\Omega_{sys, A} = \Omega_{sys, B} = 1
$$

but

$$
\Omega_{bath, A} > \Omega_{bath, B}
$$

thus

$$
\Omega_{tot, A} > \Omega_{tot, B}
$$

when energy of the system increases, the volume doesn't change. we have

$$
(\frac{\partial S}{\partial U})_V = \frac{1}{T}
$$

and 

$$
\frac{dln\Omega_{bath}}{dE_{bath}} = \frac{1}{kT}
$$

since the bath is very larger than the system, we use the change from A to B to approximate the derivative

$$
\frac{ln\Omega_{bath, B} - ln\Omega_{bath, A}}{E_{bath, b} - E_{bath, A}} = \frac{1}{kT}
$$

since $E_{bath, b} = E_{tot} - E_m$ and $E_{bath, a} = E_{tot}$, change to exp form

$$
\Omega_{bath, B} = \Omega_{bath, A} \exp(\frac{-E_{m}}{kT})
$$

we find $\Omega_{bath, A}$ is not a function of $E_{m}$, so we have

$$
\Omega_{bath, B} \propto \exp(\frac{-E_{m}}{kT})
$$

we recall the probability is proportional to number of microstate, so

$$
P_{m} \propto \exp(\frac{-E_m}{kT})
$$
