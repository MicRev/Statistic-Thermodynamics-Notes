## Internal Energy

$$
U = \sum_m P_m E_m
$$

where the probability of a microstate of being an Energy of $E_m$ is $P_m$.

Known $P_m$ can be expressed by $E_m$, change the fomula

$$
U = \frac{1}{Q_N} \sum_m E_m \exp(\frac{-E_m}{kT})
$$

const V, 

$$
\frac{\partial Q_N}{\partial T} = \frac{\partial }{\partial T} \sum \exp(\frac{-E_m}{kT}) = \frac{1}{kT^2}\sum E_m \exp(\frac{-E_m}{kT})
$$

thus

$$
\sum E_m \exp(\frac{-E_m}{kT}) = kT^2\frac{\partial Q_N}{\partial T}
$$

so

$$
U = \frac{1}{Q_N}kT^2\frac{\partial Q_N}{\partial T} \\
=kT^2\frac{\partial lnQ_N}{\partial T}
$$

Assert about Helmholtz energy

$$
A = -kTlnQ_N
$$

Known

$$
(\frac{\partial A}{\partial T})_V = -S
$$

so

$$
S = -\frac{\partial }{\partial T}(-kTlnQ_N) \\
=klnQ_N+kT(\frac{\partial lnQ_N}{\partial T})_V
$$

known the relationship between $A$ and $Q_N$, we can calculate the relationships of other thermodynamic functions

## Non-interacting particles

In this case, we can assume that the energy levels of a system are just those available to the particles which makes up the system

Energy of the system is the sum of those of the particles

$$
E_m = \epsilon_i^{(A)} + \epsilon_j^{(B)} +\epsilon_k^{(C)} + \cdots
$$

partition function, defined by

$$
Q_N = \sum \exp(\frac{-E_m}{kT})
$$

becomes

$$
Q_N = \sum_i \exp(\frac{\epsilon_i^{(A)}}{kT})
      \sum_j \exp(\frac{\epsilon_j^{(B)}}{kT})
      \sum_k \exp(\frac{\epsilon_k^{(C)}}{kT})
      \cdots
$$

assume A, B and C ... are the same 

$$
Q_N = \left[\sum \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_i^{(A)}}{kT})\right]^N
$$

inside the "[ ]" we define it as the molecule partition function $q$

$$
q = \sum \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_i}{kT})
$$

and
 
$$
Q_N = q^N
$$

Knowing the energy levels of a single molecule, we can calculate $q$.

Only available for **distinguishable** pariticles

I there is only one particle for one ene. lev,cfor indistinguishable particles,

$$
Q_N = \frac{q^N}{N!}
$$

Exception takes place in solid, where indistinguishable particles become distinguishable in seperated latices

for **Distinguishable** particles

$$
A = -kTlnQ_N = -kTNlnq \\ ~ \\
S = klnQ_N+kT(\frac{\partial lnQ_N}{\partial T})_V = kNlnq + NKT(\frac{\partial lnq}{\partial T}) \\ ~ \\
U = kT^2\frac{\partial lnQ_N}{\partial T} = NkT^2 \frac{\partial lnq}{\partial T}
$$

for **Indistinguishable** particles

*Stirling's approximation*: $lnN! = NlnN-N$

$$
S = kln(\frac{q^N}{N!})+kT(\frac{\partial ln(q^N/N!)}{\partial T})_V \\ ~ \\
U = kT^2\frac{\partial ln(q^N/N!)}{\partial T}
$$

## Energy level

Seperation of the total energy of a molecule:
- Translational
- Rotational
- Vibrational
- Electronal

Scale of the energy level: Elec. > Vib. > Rot.

Reasonable to consider the energy levels of different motions are **decoupled**

every motion has its partition funcion

$$
q_{trans} = \sum \exp (\frac{-\epsilon_{trans, i}}{kT})
$$

As energy is **addable**, partition funcion is **multipliable**

$$
q = q_{trans}q_{rot}q_{vib}q_{elec}
$$

Usually choose the ground state as the energy zero point, that is when $i = 0$, $\epsilon_0 = 0$

so the partition function becomes

$$
q' = 1 + \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_1}{kT}) + \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_2}{kT}) + \cdots
$$

In reality, all cases donot follow the assumption, that is $\epsilon_0 \ne 0$

$$
q = \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_0}{kT}) + \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_0-\epsilon_1}{kT}) + \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_0-\epsilon_2}{kT}) + \cdots \\
=\exp(\frac{-\epsilon_0}{kT})(1 + \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_1}{kT}) + \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_2}{kT}) + \cdots) \\
=\exp(\frac{-\epsilon_0}{kT})q'
$$

this makes sense when applying to $U$

$$
kT^2\frac{\partial lnQ_N}{\partial T} = NkT^2 \frac{\partial lnq}{\partial T} \\ ~ \\
=NkT^2 \frac{\partial lnq' - \epsilon_0/kT}{\partial T} \\~\\
=NkT^2 \frac{\partial lnq'}{\partial kT} + N\epsilon_0
$$

same when $A$ and $S$.

trans and rot corresponds with this assumption, but vib and elec doesn't
