## Evaluationg q - the importance of kT

known

$$
q' = 1 + \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_1}{kT}) + \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_2}{kT}) + \cdots
$$

the minumum of q' is 1

how many terms to include?

later terms gets smaller when $\epsilon$ increases

when $\epsilon >> kT$, the exp term << 1

consequently, 

> only terms with $\epsilon$ comparable or less than $kT$ makes a significant contribution to the partition function 

we have discussed that only energy levels whose energies are much less than $kT$ will be occupied, and these are those terms which contributes significantly to the partition function

or, suppose the differential of energy levels are $\Delta$, we gave

$$
q' = 1 + \exp(\frac{-\Delta}{kT}) + \exp(\frac{-2\Delta}{kT}) + \cdots \\\\
= \sum_{i=0}(\exp(\frac{-i\Delta}{kT}))
$$

if $i\Delta$ is much greater than kT, the second term is much less than 1, so the partition function is $1$

if $i\Delta$ is much less than kT, the terms will be effective until it reaches $i$ that makes $i\Delta = kT$

if $i\Delta$ is similar to kT, a few terms will be effective

From Boltzmann distribution we see only those energy levels whose $\epsilon_i << kT$ will be populated. We can therefore identify that q is the **number of accessible states **

## evaluating q by intergral

suppose $\epsilon$ is small enough, we have

$$
q' = \int_0^\infty\exp(\frac{-i\Delta}{kT})di
$$

the greater $\epsilon$ is, the worse the appoximation of intergration is.

> if $\Delta = 0.05kT$, q' by intergral is 20, by sum is approx. 20.5; if $\Delta = kT$, q' by intergral is 1, by sum is apporx. 1.58.

therefore we can calculate the partial deravetive of $q$ to $T$

term by term,

$$
\frac{\partial q}{\partial T} = \frac{\partial }{\partial T} \sum_{i=0}(\exp(\frac{-\epsilon_i}{kT})) \\~\\
= \frac{1}{kT^2} \sum_{i=0} \epsilon_i \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_i}{kT})
$$

## Degeneracy

if some energy levels are degenerated with $g_j$, it is more convenient to change the form like 
$$
q = \sum_j g_j \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_j}{kT})
$$

## Partition function in particular cases

### Translational

in one-dimension translation, we are familiar that

$$
E_m = \frac{n^2h^2}{8ma^2}
$$

in order to find out whether it is reasonable to use intergral to substitude the sum, we try to find the maximum of n:
$$
\frac{n_{max}^2h^2}{8ma^2} = kT
$$

hence

$$
n_{max}^2 = \frac{8ma^2kT}{h^2}
$$

in a box lengthing 10cm, $n_{max} = 2\times 10^9$

so the assumption is reasonable.

therefore

$$
q_{trans, 1D} = \sum_n^\infty \exp(\frac{-E_n}{kT}) = \int_0^\infty \exp(\frac{-E_n}{kT})dn
$$

the intergral is 

$$
\int_0^\infty \exp(\frac{-E_n}{kT})dn =\int_0^\infty \exp(\frac{-n^2h^2}{8ma^2kT})dn
$$

we are familiar of the intergral of the Gauss Function 
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} exp(-\alpha x^2) dx = \sqrt{\pi/\alpha}
$$

consequently

$$
q_{trans, 1D} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{8mkTa^2\pi}{h^2} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} = \left(\frac{2\pi mkT}{h^2} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$

alternatively, we write **thermal wavelength**

$$
\Lambda = \left(\frac{h^2}{2\pi mkT} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$

giving

$$
q_{trans, 1D} = \frac{a}{\Lambda}
$$

As for 3-dimension case, 

$$
E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = \frac{h^2}{8ma^2}(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2)
$$

and 

$$
q_{trans, 3D} = q_{trans, x} q_{trans, y} q_{trans, z} \\
 = \left(\frac{2\pi mkT}{h^2} \right)^{\frac{3}{2}} a^3 \\ 
 = \left(\frac{2\pi mkT}{h^2} \right)^{\frac{3}{2}} V
$$

or 

$$
q_{trans, 3D} = \frac{V}{\Lambda^3}
$$

### Rotational

We are familiar that

$$
E_J = BJ(J+1)
$$

$J$ is the rotational quantum number, each energy level has a degeneracy of $2J+1$.

B is the rotational constant, valuing

$$
B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}
$$

$I$ is the moment of inertia.

To calculate the $E_J$ in form of wavelength and in unit $cm^{-1}$, we have

$$
\widetilde{E} = \widetilde{B}J(J+1)
$$

where
$$
\widetilde{B} = \frac{h}{8\pi^2 \widetilde{c}I}
$$

c is the speed of light in cm/s

partition function of rotational system

$$
q_{rot} = \sum_{j=0}^\infty (2J+1) \exp(\frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT})
$$

Energies of the first several energy levels looks like $0, 2B, 6B, \cdots$. To use intergral, we need to compare B to kT. Calculation shows that in room temperature, kT is significantly in excess of B

thus

$$
q_{rot} = \int_0^\infty (2J+1)\exp(\frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT})dJ
$$

noticing that 

$$
\frac{d}{dJ}\exp(\frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT}) = \frac{-B(2J+1)}{kT} \exp(\frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT})
$$

so we have

$$
q_{rot} = \left. \left[\frac{-kT}{B} \exp(\frac{-BJ(J+1)}{kT})\right] \right |_0^\infty \\
=\frac{kT}{B}
$$

commonly we define a rotational temperature $\theta_{rot} = B/K$, and the partition function becomes

$$
q_{rot} = \frac{kT}{\sigma B} = \frac{T}{\sigma \theta_{rot}}
$$

where $\sigma$ is the symmetry parameter, it takes 2 when homonuclear and 1 elsewise.
