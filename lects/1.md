## introduction

reality: large amount of molecules distributes in different energy levels
population: number of particles in each e.l.

Boltzmann distribution

$$
n_i = \frac{N}{q} exp(\frac{-\epsilon_i}{kT})
$$

$n_i$ with e.l. $\epsilon_i$
$N$: total
$q$: partition function

ground.st.: 

$$
n_0 = \frac{N}{q}
$$

thus

$$
n_i = n_0 exp(\frac{-\epsilon_i}{kT})
$$

$n_i / n_0$ falls as $\epsilon_i$ rises

only e.l. whose energies are $\le kT$ have significant population

r.t, $kT \approx 0.026 eV$

how come

connection between quat.mac and macro world

e.g.

$$
S = kln\Omega
$$

connects entropy and 'randomness'

## 2nd Law

entropy of the universe increases in a spontaneous process
that is, $\Delta S_{univ} = \Delta S_{sys} + \Delta S_{surr} \ge 0$
entropy of an **isolated system** increases in a spontaneous process

$$
dS = \delta q_{rev} / T
$$

an infinitesmal process:
$\delta q_{rev}$ amount of heat under reversible condition and T is the temperature
rev. porc. is always essentially at an equilibrium

Entropy: **state funtion**

path function (heat, work): path-dependent
state function: path-independent

that's why $\delta q_{rev}$ rather than $dq$

## 1st Law

internal energy U

$$
dU = \delta q + \delta w
$$

q: absorbed heat
w: work down on the system

when possitive, energy into the system

gas expanding:

$$
\delta w = -p_{ext}dV
$$

and 

$$
\delta q_{rev} = Tds
$$

thus when **rev.** and gas expanding:

$$
dU = TdS - pdV
$$

so-called First law and second law combined 

const V, U varies with T

$dU = TdS~when~const~V$

$$
(\frac{\partial S}{\partial U})_V = \frac{1}{T}
$$

likewise

$$
(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V})_U = \frac{p}{T}
$$

## free energy

2nd law: 

$$
\Delta S_{univ} = \Delta S_{sys} + \Delta S_{surr} \ge 0
$$

where

$$
dS_{surr} = \delta q_{surr, rev} / T
$$

surr is large, heat is small, thus to surr, rev.
$$
\delta q_{surr} = - \delta q_{env} \\

dS_{surr} = -\delta q_{sys} / T \\

dS_{univ} = dS_{sys} - \delta q_{sys} / T
$$

Gibbs energy :

$$
G = H-TS
$$

complete diff

$$
dG = dH - TdS - SdT
$$

const T

$$
\frac{dG}{T} = \frac{dH}{T} - dS
$$

const pressure, 

$$
-\frac{dG}{T} = dS_{sys} - \delta q_{sys} / T
$$

thus 

$$
-\frac{dG}{T} = dS_{univ}
$$

Spontaneous process, $dS_{univ} > 0, dG_{sys} < 0$

## Helmhotz energy

$$
A = U - TS
$$

$$
dA = dU - TdS - SdT
$$

const T,

$$
-\frac{dA}{T} = dS - \frac{dU}{T}
$$

which is more useful in this course

const Volume,

$$
-\frac{dA_{sys} }{T} = dS_{sys} - \frac{\delta q_{sys, const.V}}{T}
$$

const S,

$$
dA = -pdV - SdT
$$

const V

$$
(\partial A / \partial T)_V = -p
$$

const T

$$
(\partial A / \partial V)_T = -S
$$

## Legendre transfrom

involving 1st & 2nd law:

$dU = TdS - pdV$

we can define other thermdyn potentials in terms of U minus conjugated pairs of intensive and extensice vars involved one or more work terms

any leg. trans (H(S, p), A(V, T), G(p, T)) contains no more or less information than U(S, V)

introducing more work forms, implying leg. trans. we get mroe equations
