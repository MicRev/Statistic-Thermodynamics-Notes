## The Pre-Expotential or A-factor

Substituting the expression of $E_a$ and $\Delta_r H^{\circ, \ddagger}$ into that of $k_{2nd}$ and we get

$$
k_{2nd} = \left[\frac{1}{c^\circ} \frac{kT}{h} \exp \left(\frac{\Delta_r S^{\circ, \ddagger}}{R} + 1 \right) \right] \exp \left(\frac{-E_a}{RT} \right)
$$

And a little rearrangement

$$
\ln \frac{k_{2nd}}{T} = \ln \frac{k}{h c^\circ} + \frac{\Delta_r S^{\circ, \ddagger}}{R} - \frac{\Delta_r H^{\circ, \ddagger}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T}\right)
$$

So a plot of $\ln (k_{2nd} / T)$ against $(1 / T)$ will be linear, which is sometimes called an Eyring plot.

## The Effect of Pressure

We know

$$
\ln k_{2nd} = \ln \frac{kT}{c^\circ h} - \frac{\Delta_r G^{\circ, \ddagger}}{RT}
$$

To find the effect of pressure, we take the partial derivative

$$
\left(\frac{\partial \ln k_{2nd}}{\partial p} \right)_T = - \frac{1}{RT} \left(\frac{\partial \Delta_r G^{\circ, \ddagger}}{\partial p} \right)_T
$$

And since ${\partial G} / {\partial p} = V$, we have

$$
\left(\frac{\partial \Delta_r G^{\circ. \ddagger}}{\partial p} \right)_T = \Delta_r V^{\circ, \ddagger}
$$

Which is called the standard molar volume of activation.

Thus

$$
\left(\frac{\partial \ln k_{2nd}}{\partial p} \right)_T = \frac{- \Delta_r V^{\circ, \ddagger}}{RT}
$$

Assume that $\Delta_r V^{\circ, \ddagger}$ does not vary with pressure, we take the intergral

$$
\int d \ln k_{2nd} = - \frac{\Delta_r V^{\circ, \ddagger}}{RT} \int dp
$$

and get

$$
\ln k_{2nd} = \frac{-\Delta_r V^{\circ, \ddagger}}{RT}p + \operatorname{const.}
$$

Using the definite intergral, usually from standard pressure we get

$$
\ln \left(\frac{k_{2nd} (p)}{k_{2nd} (p^\circ)} \right) = \frac{-\Delta_r V^{\circ, \ddagger}}{RT} (p - p^\circ)
$$
