### Rotational for non-linear molecules

three moment of inertia: $I_a, I_b, I_c$ associating with three rotational constance

$$
\widetilde{A} = \frac{h}{8\pi^2 \widetilde{c} I_a}
$$

and similarly they are associated with three rotational temperatures

$$
\theta_{rot, A} = \frac{\widetilde{A}}{k}
$$

therefore

$$
q_{rot} = \frac{\pi^2}{\sigma} \left(\frac{T^3}{\theta_{rot, A}\theta_{rot, B}\theta_{rot, C}} \right)
$$

## Vibrational 

for simple harmonic oscillator, we are **familiar** that 

$$
E_v = (v + \frac{1}{2}) \hbar\omega = (v+\frac{1}{2}) h\nu_0
$$

in ground state, 

$$
E_0 = \frac{1}{2}h\nu
$$

so the energy related to the ground state is 

$$
E_v = vh\nu
$$

therefore

$$
q'_{vib} = \sum_{\nu=0}^\infty \exp(-\frac{vh\nu_0}{kT})
$$

Calculatoin shows that even the lowest vib. freq. is much greater than kT at room temperature, so it is not reasonable to use intergral.

Actually, it turns out to be convenient to directly calculate the geometry progression. According to basic math, we all know when being a kid aging 7 that when conditions are approprate,

$$
a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \cdots = \frac{a}{1-r}
$$

requiring $r < 1$

therefore, even a kid can calculate that

$$
q'_{vib} = \frac{1}{1-\exp(\frac{-h\nu_0}{kT})}
$$

define a vibrational temperature $\theta_v = \frac{h\nu_0}{k}$ or $\theta_v = \frac{\widetilde{\omega}}{k}$, we have

$$
q'_{vib} = \frac{1}{1- \exp(\frac{-\theta_{vib}}{T})}
$$

considering ground state energy, 

$$
q = q'\exp(\frac{-\epsilon_0}{kT})
$$

therefore

$$
q_{vib} = \frac{\exp(\frac{-h\nu_0}{2kT})}{1-\exp(\frac{-h\nu_0}{kT})} = \frac{\exp(\frac{-\theta_{vib}}{2T})}{1-\exp(\frac{-\theta_{vib}}{T})}
$$

## More complex system

vibration is made up of several normal modes. For $i$th normal mode, the partition function is 

$$
q_{vib, i} = \frac{\exp(\frac{-\theta_{vib, i}}{2T})}{1-\exp(\frac{-\theta_{vib, i}}{T})}
$$

and the total partition function is the found by multiplying those of normal modes

$$
q_{vib} = q_{vib, 1} q_{vib, 2} q_{vib, 3} \cdots
$$

## Electronic partition function

It is all the same that 

$$
q_{elec} = \sum_j g_j \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_{elec, j}}{kT})
$$

where the $g_j$ can be determined by term symbols, known as $~^{2S+1}L_J$, and the degeneracy is $2J+1$

relating to the ground state, the energy can be expressed as

$$
q_{elec}' = g_0 + g_1 \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_{elec, 1}}{kT}) + g_2 \exp(\frac{-\epsilon_{elec, 2}}{kT}) + \cdots
$$

## Isotopic substitusion 

The only problem is that the mass changes. To a good approximation, the bond length and force constant remains the same.

Rotational constant changes. We remenber in [Lecture 4](4.md) that

$$
B = \frac{\hbar}{2I}
$$

where

$$
I = \mu R^2
$$

thus

$$
\frac{B_A}{B_B} = \frac{\mu_B}{\mu_A}
$$

also for the vibrational frequency, there is

$$
\nu = \widetilde{\omega} = \sqrt{\frac{k_{force}}{\mu}}
$$

assuming the force constant remains the same, we have

$$
\frac{\nu_A}{\nu_B} = \frac{\widetilde{\omega}_A}{\widetilde{\omega}_B} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_B}{\mu_A}}
$$

## Seperation contribution 

A partition function can be written as a product of several ones:

$$
q = q_{trans} q_{rot} q_{vib} q_{elec}
$$

Also thermodynamic functions can be written as the ln form of $q$s, i. e.

$$
A = -kTlnQ_N = -kTln\frac{q^N}{N!}
$$

thus we have

$$
A = A_{trans} + A_{rot} + A_{vib} + A_{elec}
$$

usually there is only one N! term which is in $A_{trans}$
