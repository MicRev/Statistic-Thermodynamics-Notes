## Disassociation of diatomic

Consider the reaction
$$
A_2 \rightleftharpoons 2A
$$

The common energy zero is the energy of the dissociated atoms, and the energy of $A_2$ is $D_e$ lower.

Thus we derive the expression of $K_c$
$$
K_c = \frac{f_A^2}{f_{A_2}} \frac{1}{c^\circ} \exp (-\Delta \epsilon / kT)
$$

where 
$$
\Delta \epsilon = 2\epsilon_0^{A} - \epsilon_0^{A_2} = 0 - (-D_e) = D_e
$$

Thus
$$
K_c = \frac{f_A^2}{f_{A_2}} \frac{1}{c^\circ} \exp (- D_e / kT)
$$

## Ionization of atoms

Ionization of gas atoms can be calculated $K_c$ easily. The equilibrium
$$
M \rightleftharpoons M^+ + e^-
$$

Choosing the common energy zero as the energy of $M^+ + e^-$, $\Delta \epsilon_0$ will equal to the ionization energy $E_I$. Thus
$$
K_c = \frac{f_e f_{M^+}}{f_M} \frac{1}{c^\circ} \exp (-E_I / kT)
$$

Reasonably we assume the movement of $M$ and $M^+$ are quite the same, the only difference occurs when we consider the electrons. And assuming only ground state of electron is occupied, we have $q_elec = g_0 = 2$. Thus
$$
K_c = \left( \frac{2\pi m_e kT}{h^2} \right)^{\frac{3}{2}} \frac{2 g_{0, M^+}}{g_{0, M}} \frac{1}{c_0} \exp (-E_I / kT)
$$

which is known as *Saha Equation*.

## Adsorption of a gas on a surface

Adsorption is commonly observed in catalystic process and gas-solid or liquid-solid reactions. 

A simple model is that there are a number of independent equivalent **sites** on the surface which can be occupied by gas molecules. Thus there is Langmuir isotherm
$$
\theta = \frac{K_{ads}p}{1 + K_{ads}p}
$$

where $\theta$ is the fraction of occupied sites, $p$ the pressure and $K_{ads}$ a constant.

Low pressure, $K_{ads} p \ll 1$, so $\theta = K_{ads}p$, i.e. the fraction is linear to pressure.

High pressure, $K_{ads}p \gg 1$, so $\theta = 1$, i.e. all sites are occupied.

To explain the Langmuir isotherm, we start by recognizing that when equilibrium,
$$
\mu_{ads} = \mu_g
$$

For gas, the chemical potential
$$
\mu_g = \mu^{\circ} + RT\ln \frac{p}{p^\circ}
$$

For adsorbed molecules, we calculate the chemical potentail by statistical thermodynamic methods. We are familiar that the Helmholtz energy
$$
A = -kT\ln Q_N
$$

where $Q_N$ is the partition function fo the system. 

Suppose there are $M$ **distinguishable** active sites and $N$ **indistinguishable** molecules adsorbed on the surface, not so trivially that the number of ways of distribution is 
$$
\frac{M!}{N!(M-N)!}
$$

Noting the partition function of a single molecule as $q$, for N particles the contribution is $q^N$. Thus the overall partition function is
$$
Q_N = q^N \frac{M!}{N!(M-N)!}
$$

Substitude it into the expression of $A$, we get
$$
A = kT\left[-N \ln q- M \ln M - N \ln N + (M-N) \ln (M-N) \right]
$$

and by definition
$$
\mu = \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial N} \right)_{V, T}
$$

thus we calculate the chemical potential of adsorbed molecules
$$
\mu_{ads} = kT \left[-\ln q + \ln \frac{N}{M-N} \right]
$$

Since the fraction of occupied sites $\theta$ is $N / M$, we get
$$
\mu_{ads} = kT\left[-\ln q + \ln \frac{\theta}{1 - \theta} \right]
$$

When equilibrium, substituding both sides of the equation and we get
$$
\mu^\circ + kT\ln \frac{p}{p^\circ} = kT \left[-\ln q  +\ln \frac{\theta}{1-\theta} \right]
$$

Reararnge it
$$
b \frac{p}{p^\circ} = \frac{\theta}{1-\theta}
$$
where
$$
b = q\exp \left(\frac{\mu^\circ}{kT} \right)
$$

from which we derive the expression of $\theta$
$$
\theta = \frac{b(p / p^\circ)}{1 + b(p / p^\circ)}
$$

We let
$$
K_{ads} = (q / p^\circ) \exp \left(\frac{\mu^\circ}{kT}\right)
$$

and get
$$
\theta = \frac{K_{ads}p}{1 + K_{ads}p}
$$

## Rate constant

Seemingly oddly statistical thermodynamic theories can be applied in knetics problems. But within expectation, the calculations are complicated, so the theories are more often used as a qualitative consideration of measuring the affect of each factors rather than a precise predictor.

One powerful method to consider such problems is by applying potential energy surface (PES ~~(photon electon spectra)~~). The potential energy is the function of large numbers of coordinates of atoms.

In PES there are certain points which give the local minimas, where the arrangement of atoms is stable. 

First consider a simple reaction
$$
A + BC \rightarrow AB + C
$$

For further simplification, all molecules are limited to move linearly and the three atoms are always in a line. Therefore, the potential will be a function of only two variables $r_{AB}$ and $r_{BC}$. 

First consider some extreme conditions. When $A$ is far from $BC$, the PE depends only on $r_{BC}$. When $C$ is far from $AB$, the PE depends only on $r_{AB}$. When all three atoms are far from each other, the PE is just the sum of that of seperate atoms.

Anyway, by calculation, we get the PES:

Our reactants will walk under the minimum PE path to reach the products. And on the local maximum on the path, it is called a transition state.

From the reactant to the transition state there is an extra energy, which we usually call activation energy.
